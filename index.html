                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Natural History:</strong>
                        Dolphins can live in either fresh or salt water. Distributed in marine environments worldwide, 
                        they range from equatorial to subpolar waters and also can be found in many major river systems. 
                        The common and bottlenose dolphins are widely distributed in warm and temperate seas. 
                        They are swift swimmers; the bottlenose can attain speeds of nearly 30 km/hr (18.5 mph) in short bursts, 
                        and common dolphins are even faster. Most river dolphins live in fresh water that may be several thousand 
                        kilometres from the sea, although some spend their lives in coastal waters. Dolphins are social, 
                        gathering in schools from five to several thousand. All are carnivorous, feeding on fish, squid, 
                        and other invertebrates.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Socialization:</strong>
                        Dolphins are highly social animals, often living in pods of up to a dozen individuals, though pod 
                        sizes and structures vary greatly between species and locations. In places with a high abundance of 
                        food, pods can merge temporarily, forming a superpod; such groupings may exceed 1,000 dolphins. 
                        Membership in pods is not rigid; interchange is common. They establish strong social bonds, 
                        and will stay with injured or ill members, helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Reproduction and sexuality:</strong>
                        Dolphin copulation happens belly to belly; though many species engage in lengthy foreplay, the 
                        actual act is usually brief, but may be repeated several times within a short timespan. 
                        The gestation period varies with species; for the small Tucuxi dolphin, this period is around 
                        11 to 12 months, while for the orca, the gestation period is around 17 months. 
                        Typically dolphins give birth to a single calf, which is, unlike most other mammals, 
                        born tail first in most cases.[90] They usually become sexually active at a young age, 
                        even before reaching sexual maturity.[87] The age of sexual maturity varies by species and sex.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Sleeping:</strong>
                        Generally, dolphins sleep with only one brain hemisphere in slow-wave sleep at a time, thus maintaining 
                        enough consciousness to breathe and to watch for possible predators and other threats. Sleep stages earlier 
                        in sleep can occur simultaneously in both hemispheres.[98][99][100] In captivity, dolphins seemingly enter 
                        a fully asleep state where both eyes are closed and there is no response to mild external stimuli. In this case, 
                        respiration is automatic; a tail kick reflex keeps the blowhole above the water if necessary. Anesthetized 
                        dolphins initially show a tail kick reflex
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Feeding:</strong>
                        There are various feeding methods among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. 
                        Fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. 
                        Orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves.[104] Different breeds of dolphins vary 
                        widely in the number of teeth they possess. The orca usually carries 40–56 teeth while the popular bottlenose 
                        dolphin has anywhere from 72 to 116 conical teeth and its smaller cousin the common dolphin has 188–268 teeth: 
                        the number of teeth that an individual carries varies widely between within a single species. Hybrids between 
                        common and bottlenose bred in captivity had a number of teeth intermediate between that of their parents..
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Conservation status:</strong>
                        Information regarding current population levels and trends remains elusive for many dolphin species. 
                        Although bottlenose dolphins are species of least concern, according to the International Union for Conservation
                         of Nature (IUCN), several dolphins are at risk of extinction. Dolphin species that the IUCN considers 
                         vulnerable or near threatened include the Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin (Sousa chinensis), 
                         the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris), and the Australian snubfin dolphin (O. heinsohni). 
                         The most vulnerable dolphins include the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) and the Indus 
                         river dolphin (P. minor), which are classified as endangered species, and the Atlantic humpbacked 
                         dolphin (Sousa teuszii), which is classified as critically endangered.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Paleontology and classification:</strong>
                        Dolphins first appear as fossils from the Early Miocene Epoch (23 million to 16 million years ago)—a 
                        time when the cetacean fauna was more diverse. All of today’s dolphin groups were present in the 
                        Miocene, as were at least three extinct families whose members would be called dolphins 
                        (Eurhinodelphidae, Hemisyntrachelidae, and Acrodelphidae).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Threats:</strong>
                        Dolphins have few marine enemies. Some species or specific populations have none, making them apex predators. 
                        For most of the smaller species of dolphins, only a few of the larger sharks, such as the bull shark, 
                        dusky shark, tiger shark and great white shark, are a potential risk, especially for calves. 
                        Some of the larger dolphin species, especially orcas, may also prey on smaller dolphins, 
                        but this seems rare. Dolphins also suffer from a wide variety of diseases and parasites
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Impacts of climate change:</strong>
                        Dolphins are marine mammals with broad geographic extent, making them susceptible to climate change in 
                        various ways. The most common effect of climate change on dolphins is the increasing water temperatures 
                        across the globe. This has caused a large variety of dolphin species to experience range shifts, in which 
                        the species move from their typical geographic region to cooler waters. Another side effect of increasing 
                        water temperatures is the increase in harmful algae blooms, which has caused a mass die-off of bottlenose dolphins.
